# Project--Hadoop-18


**In this project we will be using Spark with Python to find the minimum temperature for a given year for a given place from 1800.csv dataset.**

**Before diving into the project lets get to know about Spark**...<br></br>

**What is Apache Spark**?<br></br>
Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.

**This dataset which we downloaded contains 4 columns:** <br></br>
 **(Place-Id):** The id of the place<br></br>
 **(Timestamp):** The time and date at which the temperature is recorded<br></br>
 **(Type):** The three different weather recordings of a given place (TMAX,TMIN,PRCP) <br></br>
 **(Temperature):** The temperature of a given place <br></br>
 
 **Important Note: Go through the dataset before jumping to the code.**

 **So what are you waiting for..? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section üòÅüòÇ. Thanks!**
